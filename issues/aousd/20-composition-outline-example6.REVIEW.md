Item: aousd/20-composition-outline-example6
Verdict: FILE
Reviewer: independent follow-up session; these drafts predate this review.
Reviewer environment: Linux x86-64, CPython 3.11, official PyPI usd-core==26.11;
source inspected with git show v26.11.1:<path>, not the fork working tree.
Specification: byte-verified core/1.1.0/core_spec.md at published commit
83e25aceb11a9340db4778263bda5d5175875f49. Vendored text was not modified.

Claims checked:
  - [OK] The outline omits its returned opinion list and has unbalanced append parentheses.
  - [OK] The Example 6 root layer has no class specs; stock prim stacks contain four entries while the prim index has nospec class nodes.
  - [OK] The reference layer example is missing a closing metadata parenthesis; the repro explicitly repairs this before comparing composition.

Runtime evidence: [review output](REVIEW-2026-11-06/stock-13-21.txt).
Formal evidence: lake build, usdspec-test, and committed-vector drift check pass.
This verdict concerns the stated counterexamples and requested clarification;
it does not certify completeness of the whole formalization or C++ implementation.
